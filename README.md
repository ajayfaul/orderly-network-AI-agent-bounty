## Project Name: ML-Enhanced RSI and SMA-Based Trading Strategy

### Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-enhanced trading strategy based on technical indicators such as Simple Moving Averages (`SMA`) and the Relative Strength Index (`RSI`). The strategy utilizes a Random Forest machine learning model to predict optimal entry and exit points for long and short positions. The `goal` is to improve profitability by combining technical analysis with machine learning insights. Additionally, the strategy incorporates strict risk management protocols, including stop-loss mechanisms to minimize potential losses.

### Technical Requirements

- Python 3.9+

Libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- eth_rpc
- emp_orderly
- dotenv
- An active Empyreal Orderly SDK account for data access and backtesting functionality.
- A wallet for initializing and interacting with the SDK (private key required).

---

### Trading Strategy Specifications

- Risk Management
  The strategy includes a stop-loss mechanism to close positions when the price moves against the position by more than 2% of the entry price. This ensures controlled losses and maintains overall profitability.
- Market Focus
  The strategy is primarily designed for the BTC/USDT perpetual futures market on the Empyreal Orderly platform but can be adapted to other markets by modifying asset types.
- Time Horizon
  Short-term strategy: The strategy operates on a 15-minute interval timeframe, suitable for intra-day trading. It can be adjusted to other timeframes for different market behaviors.
- Performance Metrics:
  - Backtesting results (key metrics, not shown in the current code but can be added):
  - Profit and Loss (P&L): Measures the total profit or loss generated by the strategy during backtesting.
  - Drawdown: Tracks the largest peak-to-trough loss observed during the backtesting period.
  - Sharpe Ratio: Provides a risk-adjusted return metric, useful for comparing against a risk-free benchmark.

### How to Set Up and Deploy the Trading Strategy

1. Install dependencies: Use the following command to install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn eth_rpc emp-orderly-types emp-orderly dotenv
   ```
2. Set up environment variables
   - Create a .env file in the project root and define the following variables:
   ```bash
   PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Wallet Private Key>
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence to initialize and backtest the trading strategy.

### Core Logic of the Strategy

The core logic of the AI-Enhanced Trading Strategy combines technical indicators and machine learning. The strategy uses:

- Indicators: The strategy uses technical indicators like SMA (n1, n2) and RSI (rsi_period) to identify trends and overbought/oversold conditions.
- Machine Learning Model: A Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict optimal trading signals (buy, sell, or hold) based on historical data from the SMAs and RSI.
- Risk Management: Stop-loss logic is incorporated to protect positions if the price moves more than 2% against the entry price.

### Data Feeds

The strategy ingests real-time price data for the BTC/USDT perpetual futures from the Empyreal Orderly platform using the SDK.

### Machine Learning Algorithm

The strategy uses the Random Forest Classifier, a popular ensemble learning algorithm, to predict market behavior based on the SMA and RSI indicators.

### Target Tokens

The strategy primarily focuses on trading BTC/USDT on the Empyreal Orderly platform, but it can be extended to other tokens or asset pairs.

### Notable Points

- The strategy combines machine learning and technical indicators to enhance decision-making in short-term trading.
- The code supports easy modification to apply to different assets and trading intervals.
- The strategy is designed to maximize returns while minimizing risk, making it adaptable to various market conditions.
